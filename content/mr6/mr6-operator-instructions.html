                    CMIV rules say that for all scans with participants who are considered patients, a research nurse/physician/other healthcare provider has to be present during the whole time. For healthy volunteers this is not a requirement. Regardless, you are responsible for safety and conducting the scan. The nurse is only there for:

                    Additional ear protection can be created by placing cushions around the subject's head or using the <em>radio headphones</em>. However, good ear protection using method 1 should be sufficient.

                    <li>
                        There exist microphones and speakers inside the MR bore which allows the subject to hear and speak with the MR operator out in the control room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The communications from the control room is done via the <em>"Dock"</em> placed next to the console screen.<br>

                    <li>
                        The <em>"Dock"</em> speaker needs to be enabled in order to hear what the subject in the scanner room is saying (see figure above). It's default setting when disabled is to turn down the volume low but not complete off, so that the operator in the control room always have sound-contact with the scanner room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the operator to talk to the subject, it's import to first enable the speaker on the "Dock" so that any reply can be heard, then press the microphone button (see above) to speak.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the subject to be able to call the attention of the operator while in the scanner, he or she must have been given the <em>"alarm horn"</em> <br>

            <p>There are four task cards along the right hand side of the screen: <em>EXAM</em>, <em>VIEWING</em>, <em>FILMING</em>, and <em>3D</em> (red arrows, below).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>EXAM</em> is the interface that allows us to acquire data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>VIEWING</em> is where you can look at images that have been previously collected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>FILMING</em> is where you can prepare images to be printed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>3D</em> allows you to view 3D datasets (Structural MPRAGE) in all three orientations.

            <p><em>NOTE: You can semi-automate much of this registration process if the previous scan from your study is still on the scanner database (in the Patient Browser).

To do this, make sure the previous session in your study is highlighted in the patient browser, and then press the keyboard button for patient registration.</em></p>

            <h2>Loading sequences</h2>
            <p>On the lower right half of the screen all of the sequences within the protocol you selected during registration will appear. If you had “<em>Load Program to Queue</em>” checked on the second page of registration (above), they will also appear in the scan queue on the bottom left of the screen. However, if that was not the case, or you want extra scans included, you must move them over to the lower left by dragging them over (shown below, red arrow), or highlighting the sequences you want and clicking the (&lt;) button (red box below).</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_programcard1.jpeg" alt="scanner console program card" style="width: 600px;">

            <br>
            <p><em>
            What follows next depends on your specific study protocol at the MR sequences therein. To give an example, a fMRI BOLD scan is decribed below.
            </em></p>

            <h2>Typical fMRI BOLD scan</h2>
            <h3>Localizer</h3>
            <p>
                The first sequence in a typical fMRI study is always a localizer. If you look on the left of the localizer sequence you will notice that the localizer does not have the small “working person” icon beside it (pictured below in the red box), as the other sequences below it do. The lack of this icon means that as soon as the localizer is moved to the queue it will automatically run. Make sure you let your subject know! All of the parameters have been pre-programmed. The green circle will appear left of the scan and slowly fill to show the progress of the scan.
            </p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_programcard2.jpeg" alt="scanner console program card" style="width: 600px;">
            <!-- <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cmiv/operating-scanner-training-protocol.jpg" alt="scanner console program card" style="width: 600px;"> -->

            <p>
                As soon as the localizer is complete, the single-slice sagittal, coronal and axial views will fill the viewing windows at the top of the screen. Because the next scan has a “working man” icon, that scan's parameters will open for inspection. The scan will not run until you press the green check mark. Before doing so, you should check the brain is roughly centered in the FOV in the graphics segments at the top of the screen.
            </p>


            <h3>AutoAlign (AAScout)</h3>
            <p>Second sequence is usually the Autoalign, which allows the slice placement of subsequent scans to automatically align (For BOLD scans, the default slice angle is tilted steeper than the AC/PC Line). In the figure above, AutoAlign is about to run. When Autoalign is acquired successfully it puts new 3-axis images in the graphics segments, and updates the field-of-view position based on the subject's head position.</p>

            <p>You may note the yellow boxes , which indicate the field-of-view for the next scan, have moved – and position parameters have changed (figure below). If you have not yet put the MPRAGE or any other protocols in the scan queue, when you move the next sequence to the scan queue and open it, (by double click, or right click and selecting <em>Open</em>), it will open with the field of view properly positioned on the brain based on the AAScout results (i.e., tilts slice box to compensate for the participant's positioning).</p>

            <p>However, if you choose to not use the Autoalign, or don't like the way it aligned your slices, you are responsible for <a href="#move-slices">How do I move my slices?</a> Also, please note that Autoalign uses the body-coil, so if you happen to notice this, don't worry, it is correct.</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_programcard3.jpeg" alt="scanner console with aascout displayed" style="width: 600px;">


            <h3>Structural Scan</h3>
            <p>Next scan is usually a structual scan to registrer the following fMRI scans to. However, if a subject is scanned in multi session or runs study, this scan might only be included in the first session/run and omitted in later scan.</p> 

            <p>The parameters of the structural scan (often a T1 MPRAGE) can be edited by opening the scan as described above. Once opened, the sequence parameters will be in the lower right side panel. The parameters are displayed on many tabs but always open on the Routine Card (see above). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check the position of the yellow field-of-view/slice box</span></strong>. The example above shows where a 3D navigator will be acquired to track motion throughout the MPRAGE scan – the yellow box position for the MPRAGE scan itself will be somewhat lower. Anatomy cut off (such as the nose) can wrap and end up in the occipital lobe, so make sure you try and capture the nose within the box. </p>

            <p>To move the volume, left click the center dot (in the middle of the yellow box, with the double lines going through it). To rotate the volume, move the cursor over the centerline until you see a circular double arrow, hold the left mouse button down and rotate as needed. Grabbing any of the sides can change the FOV or slice thickness (not something you usually want to do).</p>

            <p>Tell the subject that the sequence is going to begin and click the big green check mark to start the scan.</p>


            <h3>Check the Structural Scan</h3>
            <p>Wait for the MPRAGE reconstruction to finish. This may take a few seconds, especially if the 64-channel coil is used. When the head icon is hollow (figure below, red arrow), the reconstruction is still going on. When the reconstruction has completed, a head profile icon will now be solid (figure below, upper two heads). Click on this icon.</p>

            <img decoding="async" src="images/cbs/scanner_recon_in_prog_onwhite-254x481-1-edited.jpeg" alt="scanner console scan list" width="292">

            <p>If only one series is present, drag the icon with the left mouse into one of the three window segments (figure below). If more than one series is present under the head profile icon – as will happen if you reconstruct the scan without and with intensity normalization, click on and drag only the highest series number – this is the summed average result of the intensity-normalized version of the scan (red arrow, figure below). Please note that the center slice of this series will appear in the window.</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_programcard4_annot2.jpeg" alt="scanner console T1"  width="293" height="361">

            <p>Use the dog-ears in the right upper corner to go forward and back in the image series until you find the region you want to view the positioning of your BOLD your slices on. Also, go through the entire series to check for motion.</p>

            <h3>Field Maps &amp; BOLD Scan</h3>
            <p>If you've acquiring spin-echo field map scans, do this and then the BOLD run; all the slice-placement information applies to both the field-map scans and the BOLD itself. If AAScout was used, open the sequence and make sure the automatically centered slices are positioned correctly, then click the green check box to run the scan. Please note that on occasion AutoAlign may not position the slices as you desire them, therefore you will need to <a href="#move-slices">manually set your slice prescription, as described&nbsp;below</a>. The below figure shows the slice box for the BOLD positioned on the initial three-axis localizer image, but if you've dragged the MPRAGE image up there, you can scroll through the 3D MPRAGE scan to see where the slice box will lie in every slice of the MPRAGE.</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_programcard5.jpeg" alt="scanner console field map" width="600" height="479">

            <p id="jump-test">The actual position of the individual slices can be visualized by toggling the slice view buttons in the slice position toolbar shown at right below. This is found by clicking on the head icon with the blue slice marks (red arrow at right, figure below) and then toggling the slice display buttons in the top right of the slice position toolbar. Don't use the buttons on the left of the toolbar – you could change your slice thickness or spacing! The individual slices are shown overlaid on the brain in yellow below.</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_programcard6.jpeg" alt="scanner console editing slices" width="600" height="479">


            <h3 id="test-bold">Test the protocol</h3>
            <p>To ensure you are capturing everything that you want, it is recommended that you run a test BOLD scan run with 2-4 measurements (time points) to ensure the slice positioning and quality are good. You can use your regular fMRI sequence and just change the number of time points manually. This can be changed on the BOLD Card (below, arrow), in the field Measurements. Enter 2 and then hit return. This should be done before you run any other optional scans such as the field map.</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_noTRs.jpeg" alt="scanner console BOLD card" width="338" height="206">

            <p>
            If you decide to adjust the slice orientation given your test scan, you will have to copy the slice placement information to scans coming afterwards, as described in <a href="#move-slices">How do I move my slices?</a>
            </p>

            <p>
            If you didn't move the slices, then you go a head with your scans as described below.
            </p>

            <h3>Running the Field Map / BOLD Scan</h3>
            <p>Now you're ready for the BOLD scan. The acquisition time of the scan will be indicated at the upper left corner of the parameter window. Remember that the time includes any dummy scans so; deduct number-of-dummies x TR from the time of the scan to calculate the length of your paradigm. Please note, if you are using&nbsp;iPAT&nbsp;or SMS, there will be additional time added on also, however the first trigger will always come with the first ‘real' scan.</p>

            <p>Click the green check mark.</p>

            <p>The BOLD scans always have a two-step process to begin. Clicking&nbsp;green check mark&nbsp;begins the pre-scan routine of frequency and shim check. All other scans begin automatically at this point, however for a BOLD scan, you may want to not start the scan until your subject and stimulus computer are ready. The “gray triangle” icon beside the scan name (red box, below) achieves this: instead of the scan starting automatically, a pop up window will appear.</p>

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/cbs/scanner_continueBOLD.jpeg" alt="scanner console bold pause window" width="395" height="480">

            <p>When you have everything ready to go, click <em>Continue</em> (red arrow above). The scan begins immediately. Make sure to open the&nbsp;Inline Display (figure below, top right box), if it doesn't open automatically. You open it by clicking the head icon at far right, and can expand it by dragging the corner. Inline Display shows your functional images immediately after the images are reconstructed – image number is given in the upper left of this window. This allows you to monitor if your subject is moving, or if there are unwanted artifacts.</p>

            <p>
            If you want more runs with the exact same parameters, right click on the one you want to copy and select append. If you want the same slice prescription but a different # of measurements, right click on the functional, select append, open, and make the changes as described above and click the green check box.

            <p>To move your slices, hover the cursor over the center of the yellow FOV box. The cursor will change to a cross shape (top, image below), meaning it is safe to drag the box around. If you want to rotate your slices, move your cursor to the edge of the box till you get a double arrow circle icon (bottom, image below), then you can drag and rotate. If you drag or grab anywhere else, you could change the FOV, which is bad and can change things like your voxel size.</p>

            <p>Once you verify that this is where you want your slices, usually via <a href="#test-bold">a test scan</a>, you will have to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">copy the slice information to future scans that should use the same FOV</span></strong>.<p> 

            To do this:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Bring up your next scan for editing by double clicking it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then right click the test scan with the proper slice positioning and select <em>Copy parameters</em> from the menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the list of parameters you want the second option, <em>Slices &amp; saturation regions</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <em>OK</em>. Now the slices for the new scan are in the same location as the test scan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can now hit the green check mark to save the updated slices and run the scan.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>
            Note: You can copy parameters this between any pairs of scans.
            </p></em>

            <p>Alternatively to manually copying parameters, if you are running a bunch of the same scans in a row, you can right click on the current one and hit append, this will place another copy of the run in the list, and will include the updated slice information.

            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 430px;" src="images/cbs/scanner_tablemove.jpeg" alt="scanner table move warning">

            <p>Until a reference scan has been acquired, the scanner is using as its frame of reference the magnet isocenter – the center of the magnetic field, which is in the geometric center of the bore tube. This could, in principle, differ from the reference position, called REFERENCE, which we use. The reference we want to use is the center of our subject's body part, which we have marked with the laser prior to putting the bed into the magnet.</p>

            <p>As soon as a first image has been acquired using the REFERENCE positioning mode, the scanner software then ‘knows' to reference all subsequent images relative to that first image. This allows you to prescribe slices on each subsequent image however you like, and the scanner will track where you are in space. This stays true throughout your scan session provided you don't move the patient table.</p>

                    In case you need to abort a scan, for example if the subject is panicking or for any other reasons needs to be evacuated, it is good to practice the steps laid out below:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        The first thing to do is to stop the scan by pressing the red stop button.<br>

                    <li>
                        Next, communicate with the subject so that he/she knows that you have heard them and that you are getting them out the scanner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before running into scanner room, <strong>make sure not to bring with you anything magnetic</strong>, which could be easily forgotten in stressful situations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the scanner room, the fastest way to get the subject out of the scanner is to press the home button, see <a href="#position-subject">How do I position a subject in the scanner?</a>

            <!-- Text -->

            <p><strong>Please Note: USB Drives may only be plugged into the satellite console. They should never be plugged into the main host PC. Follow these steps only on the satellite console!! This protects the host PC from picking up viruses and malware.</strong></p>

            <p>
                To maintain your own personal back-ups of your data, we highly recommend the use of a portable USB hard-drive. These are the fastest way to export your data after the network send. In a pinch, a FLASH drive can be used, but these are usually slower, and not recommended for long-term storage. &nbsp;Make sure what ever storage device choose to use does not want to install any software on the satellite console because you will not be allowed to and then the console computer may not be able to mount the drive. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure your USB drive is plugged into one of the USB ports on the front of the satellite console computer. Highlight your study in the subject/data browser, as shown in<a href="#forsknings-pacs">sending to Forsknings-PACS</a>, but ensure a specific series/scan is not highlighted. Then, use the transfer pull down menu and choose “Export to Offline...”.<br>

            <!-- Text -->

            <p>
                Sometimes you will want to export information from the camera regarding your study protocol, slice prescription or images generated using the image viewer. We here describe some common strategies.
            </p>

            <h2 id="screen-shot">Exporting using a Screen Shot</h2>
            <p>
            The simplest way yo export information is to generate a <em>Screen Shot</em> of whatever is shown on the console window.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Hit the <em>PrtScr</em> button at the top of the keyboard, above the cursor keys. A copy of the entire screen is saved on the clipboard in Windows 7.<br>
                    <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 400px;" style="width: 150px;" src="images/cbs/scanner_prtscr-button.jpeg" alt="Prt Scr button">

                <li>
                    Press <em>Control</em> and <em>Escape</em>, as described in <a href="#external-drive">How do I export my data to an external drive?</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This brings up the Windows start-up menu from the bottom left of the screen. Move the Cursor up and choose <em>Paint</em>. Paint is a crude image processing application in Windows (like Notepad is to MS Word) You'll get a blank canvas.<br>
                    <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 300px;" src="images/cbs/scanner_Paint.png" alt="windows start menu">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use <em>Ctl-V </em>or pull down edit/paste to paste your screenshot into Paint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can trim the screenshot down to just the desired portion of the screen, if you choose. However, this is done by selecting the sections to delete, so it can become tedious.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can save the screen-shot to your USB FLASH or external USB hard-drive, in jpg, tiff or png format, for later use such as annotating or for inclusion in documents, etc.
                </li>
            </ol>


            <h2>Printing using built-in functionality</h2>
            <p>
            The console also has specific methods for exporting information from the system. Below we describe how you print you slice prescription and study protocol.

It might say, for example: “Waiting for scan instructions,” or “Waiting for slice positioning,” or “Scanning 00:09 (196/200 B).” That last message tells you there are 9 seconds left in the current scan, and that it's just finished acquiring 196 of 200 repetitions in a time series. The other messages are usually self-explanatory.</p>

                On rare occasions, the patient table may freezes if something gets caught in its guide-path, or the scanner gets confused. The solution, for the most part, depends on what happened to cause this in the first place. The Prisma system has a very detailed screen above the magnet bore, and the instructions to solve the table issue will be given on this screen. Just follow the instructions for the particular problem at hand.

            <p>All warnings and errors are represented as pop up boxes and/or as icons at the bottom of the screen.</p>

            <p>
                This is what it looks like without any errors:<br>
                <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 500px;" src="images/cbs/Icons_SystemNormal.jpeg" alt="console system normal"></p>

            <p>
                The green pie chart indicates how full the system's image storage capacity is. Holding the mouse over the pie chart gives the exact database capacity in a pop-up. We keep this under 70% to ensure smooth operation of the scanner. The waveform indicates the scanner's acquisition system. When there is a warning about a particular system, there will be a yellow line through it:<br>
                <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 500px;" src="images/cbs/Icons_SystemWarning.jpeg" alt="console warning"></p>

            <p>
                When there is an error, there will be a red line:<br>
                <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 500px;" src="images/cbs/Icons_SystemError.jpeg" alt="console warning"></p>

            <p>
                To view what the error/warning is, click on the icon. A pop up box will have the message. If you choose okay, it will clear the message, so it is generally better to press the close button so that these don't get cleared. It is also a good idea to write down or take a&nbsp;<a href="#screen-shot">screen shot</a>&nbsp;of the message so that you can relay it to <a href="mailto:viktor.kostic@regionostergotland.se">Viktor Kostic</a> who is responsible for MR6. If you have an error/warning during regular business hours you could try and contact Viktor directly, you will find his phone number on the white-board behind the control room.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it is after hours you can try talking to the hospital general <em>Stöd och service</em> by calling: 010 103 60 00. Hopefully you will get in contact with someone who can assist you. However, there is no guarantee; that is the risk that comes from scanning outside of business hours. There should usually be someone around between 7:30-16:00 during weekdays.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you can't get ahold of anyone and feel brave enough (aka experienced enough) to troubleshoot on your own you can try some of the tricks below. After noting the error/warning you can check on the status of that component via the System Manager. To access this, go to System (located in the bar at the top of the screen), and then go to Control via the pull down window.<br>
                <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 500px;" src="images/cbs/syscontrol.jpeg" alt="console system control">
            </p>

            <p>This will bring up a box with four tabs at the top – Host, Meas &amp; Recon, Periphery, and Tools (see below). You can check the tab that corresponds to the error message, or when in doubt, look at the first three. If things are working, they will have green checks and arrows. On the Host tab, parts of the software that are not running (eg: Spectroscopy Task) have red arrows. This is OK. If anything else is red, that means there is a problem. The first thing to try is just restarting the part that has the error.</p>

            <p>
                Sometimes, the Exam Task card will freeze, meaning you can't run the scanner. You can restart this in about 1 minute, by highlighting the Exam-Task in the Application list, and then press Stop Application, and Restart Application, on the right side.<br>
                <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 450px;" src="images/cbs/SystemManager1_annot-800x745-1.jpeg" alt="exam task card"></p>

            <p>If this doesn't solve the problem, then check the Meas &amp; Recon and Periphery tabs. There may be a hardware problem (especially if you have a yellow or red icon at the bottom of the screen) and these are quicker to fix.</p>

            <p>
            If the problem is in the Image Reconstruction system, you can choose the Meas &amp; Recon tab, and restart the image calculation software. Choose&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MrIrisContainer@mars">MrIrisContainer@mars</a>, and then click Restart at right (time to complete – about 30 seconds).&nbsp;<strong>Note: This is also a good step to do routinely before your session begins, especially if you're using cutting-edge sequences.</strong></p>

            <!-- <p>
            <strong>Update?</strong><br>
            Also note, the MrIrisContainer has been known to spontaneously re-start, especially when running scans with computationally-intensive reconstructions, so if your scan suddenly wont run in mid-session, look here. The re-start may already be underway – in which case just wait 10-20 more seconds.<br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="744" style="width: 450px;" src="images/cbs/SystemManager3_annot-800x744-1.jpeg" alt="system manager menu"></p> -->

            <p>If this doesn't solve the problem, check the Periphery tab:<br>
            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 450px;" src="images/cbs/SystemManager4-800x745-1.png" alt="periphery tab">
            </p>

            <p>This tab lists all the hardware components of the MR Scanner itself. The list should have all green checks, like in the figure above. If there are red X's, however, there's a hardware error, and the hardware system needs to be restarted or power-cycled. Go back to the Meas &amp; Recon tab (above) and either:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Restart the operating system of the MR scanner bsy clicking the “Restart Software” button (Time to complete about 3 min).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reboot the MR scanner hardware by clicking “Reboot”. (Time to complete about 5 min).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            After this procedure, check the Periphery tab – everything should have a green check, and the yellow or red lines in the icons at the bottom of the screen should be gone.
            </p>

            <p>If the scanner is still not behaving, then return to the Host tab. There are three “big-stick” options to choose from here:<br>
            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width: 450px;" src="images/cbs/SystemManager2_annot-800x750-1.jpeg" alt="system manager host menu">
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Restart the Siemens Syngo program. Click “Restart syngo MR” (Time to complete about 6-8 min).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reboot the Host computer. Click the “Reboot” button. (Time to complete about 10-12 min).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Restart the entire system. Click the “Shutdown All” to shutdown the entire MR scanner system. Once the screen states it is safe to shutdown you will need to press the blue “system off” button on the Siemens Alarm Box/Quench Button panel. Wait for a couple of minutes and the press the blue “system on” button. (Time to complete about 15 min).&nbsp;<br>

                </li>
            </ol>

            <!-- <p>
            <strong>Update?</strong><br>
            Also note that some error messages are likely to appear during the host computer shutdown and start-up –&nbsp;you can click through these as the appear, as they do not need to be reported. Also, on startup, you'll see some brief flashes of a windows desktop, and there may be a point where the system looks like it has stalled. If you see a completely black screen for more than a few seconds with just the mouse cursor arrow, you need to hit the spacebar to continue.
            </p> -->

            <p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>Whenever anything has happened that requires a reboot of the host computer or a shutdown of the scanner, please save the system log files so we can work with Siemens to assess what caused the problem. This process creates a very large file of everything the scanner was doing. Siemens accesses this remotely, and can diagnose what caused the problem. This takes about 10-20 minutes, and leaves a bright red text window on the screen until the SaveLog is complete. You can start the SaveLog procedure from the Windows Start Menu – hold Ctl and Esc together, and choose MRSaveLog from the start menu. You'll then have to enter some basic information like yor name, date/time, and what you were doing when the system crashed, before the procedure runs automatically.<br>

                    The technical room is a room located next to the scanner room and which houses several pieces of equipment that are needed for the MR scanner to function properly. It's important to have a basic knowledge of the various cabinets that exist in the technical room in order to know what to look for in case sometimes is not working properly.

                        The Cryopump, located inside the LCC cabinet, is an important piece equipment in an MR scanner, and is responsible for cooling Helium. It is this pump that makes the repetitive noise (‘hm-tjuk-hm-tjuk-hm-tjuk…’). If not, please advise the MR-manager, or other staff that can take care of the condition.

                    In general, for optimal noise-cancelling, you want two barriers of protection. Any of the two options below can be combined:
                    <ol>

                            Using traditional ear plugs.<br>

                    <li>
                        There exist microphones and speakers inside the MR bore which allows the subject to hear and speak with the MR operator out in the control room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The communications from the control room is done via the <em>Dock</em> placed next to the satellite console screen.<br>
                        <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="width:300px;" src="images/prep-scan-comm-dock.jpg" alt="communication-dock">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <em>Dock</em> speaker needs to be enabled in order to hear what the subject in the scanner room is saying (see figure above). It's default setting when disabled is to turn down the volume low but not complete off, so that the operator in the control room always have sound-contact with the scanner room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the operator to talk to the subject, it's import to first enable the speaker on the "Dock" so that any reply can be heard, then press the microphone button (see above) to speak.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the subject to be able to call the attention of the operator while in the scanner, he or she must have been given the <em>alarm horn</em> <br>

                    <li>
                        When the alarm horn has been pressed, an alarm will sound and the "Dock" will light, notifying the operator in the control room. Turn off the alarm by pressing the blinking red button and start communicating with subject.<br>

                    <li>
                        The "Dock" also has an emergency button for the operator (red button with a triangle in the picture above) to quickly cancel the scan. When pressed, the scan will be stopped and the patient table will be released so it can be manually pulled out of the scanner.<br>

                <em>
                    What follows next depends on your specific study protocol at the MR sequences therein. To give an example, a T1 mapping scan is described below.
                </em>
            </p>
            A T1 mapping scan (of a phantom) typically involves the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Position the phantom in the scanner, as explained in the previous sections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Register a new patient.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Load in the sequences (a test protocol has been created and stored in //Hospital/test_protocol_knappology)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go to "System" -> “Edit Scan Control Parameters…”, and set "Physiology Simulation” to yes under “General” (this will simulate an ECG and a respiratory signal when a phantom is used).<br>

                        <div class="column">

                </li>
                <li>
                    The first scan in any sequence (and also in our test protocol) is typically a survey scan which is used to orient future scans. Run the survey scan by clicking on the green button “Start Scan”. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The images from the survey scan should automatically be shown in the "View window" after completion which you can now use to plan the next scans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To plan a scan, double click on it (in our test protocol the next scan is the T1 mapping scan called "T1 enhanced").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now you can decide the geometry and location of the scan. The yellow box indicates the shimming box, where the B0 is kept as most homogeneous as possible. It should cover the whole region of interest. The blue slab represent the single 2D slice that will be acquired.<br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    When you are satisfied, click "Accept".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run the T1 mapping by clicking on the green button “Start Scan”. 
                </li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Aborting a scan</h2>
                <p>
                    In case you need to abort a scan, for example if the subject is panicking or for any other reasons needs to be evacuated, it is good to practice the steps laid out below:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The first thing to do is to stop the scan by pressing the red stop button (on the bore control unit in the scanner room or on the communication Dock in the control room).  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, communicate with the subject so that he/she knows that you have heard them and that you are getting them out the scanner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Before running into scanner room, <strong>make sure not to bring with you anything magnetic</strong>, which could be easily forgotten in stressful situations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the scanner room, the fastest way to get the subject out of the scanner is to press the button "release tabletop" (button 8) on the bore control unit and manually pull the table out, see <a href="#position-subject">How do I position a subject in the scanner?</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure to talk to the subject in order to reassure them that you are there and help them relax.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h2>Evacuating a subject</h2>
                <p>
                    In certain situation you might have to evacuate or move a subject from the scanner while they are still on the scanner tabletop. To this end there is a trolley (stored in the corner of the scanner room) that can be used to mount under the scanner tabletop to remove it from the scanner. To this, follow the steps below:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Start by releasing the tabletop from the scanner. This done by first moving the tabletop out the scanner and then pressing button "release tabletop" (button 8) on the bore control unit, see <a href="#position-subject">How do I position a subject in the scanner?</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, place the trolley under the tabletop. Note, the tabletop must be in the highest position (adjust if needed with button 3 on the bore control unit).
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="column" style="width: 25%;">

                        <li>
                            Lower the tabletop (using button 3 on the bore control unit) onto the trolley. <br>

                        <li>
                            The trolley will automatically hook up to the tabletop, and it will be possible to move it away from the scanner.<br>

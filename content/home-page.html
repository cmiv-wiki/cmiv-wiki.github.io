                    CMIV rules say that for all scans with participants who are considered patients, a research nurse/physician/other healthcare provider has to be present during the whole time. For healthy volunteers this is not a requirement. Regardless, you are responsible for safety and conducting the scan. The nurse is only there for:

                <p>
                    You are <strong>required</strong> to create a "Metodbok" (method book) if you are scanning participants in your study with the help of clinical staff, who will be using the book to assure that the correct scanning procedure is being followed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create a metodbok you need to consult the clinical personal in your project in order to setup the necessary documentation.
